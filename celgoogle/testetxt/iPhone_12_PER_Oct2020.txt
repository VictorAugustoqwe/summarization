Taking responsibility for  
our products at every stage 

We take responsibility for our products throughout their life cycles—including the materials 
they are made of, the people who assemble them, and how they are recycled at end of life. 
And we focus on the areas where we can make the biggest difference for our planet: reducing 
our impact on climate change, conserving important resources, and using safer materials. 

We sell millions of products. 
So making even small 
adjustments can have a 
meaningful impact.

Carbon footprint  

We continue to make progress in reducing Apple’s contribution to climate change—by 
focusing on making energy-efficient products with renewable or recycled materials and 
with renewable energy. Suppliers’ use of renewable energy through our Supplier Clean 
Energy Program and removal of select inbox accessories helped reduce emissions from 
production and transport of iPhone 12. And we continue to use low-carbon aluminum  
in the enclosure smelted using hydroelectricity rather than fossil fuels. Overall, with the 
inclusion of next-generation 5G technology, the iPhone 12 carbon footprint is about  
the same as the previous generation.4 Apple is committed to using carbon life cycle 
assessments to identify opportunities to drive down product greenhouse gas emissions.

Source Materials 

iPhone 12 is the first Apple product made with recycled tungsten, 
and the first with majority recycled rare earth elements. 

To conserve important resources, we work to reduce the material we use and aim to one day 
source only recycled or renewable materials in our products. And as we make this transition,  
we remain committed to the responsible sourcing of primary materials. We map many materials, 
some to the mineral source, and establish the strictest standards for smelters and refiners. 
We’re proud to be recognized as a worldwide leader in the responsible sourcing of minerals  
in our products. Our product designs also consider the safety of those who make, use, and 
recycle our products, restricting the use of hundreds of harmful substances. Our standards  
go beyond what’s required by law to protect people and the environment. By removing select 
inbox accessories across all of iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro models, we anticipate avoiding the 
equivalent of mining more than 600,000 metric tons of of copper, zinc, and tin ore.5

Tungsten 

Rare earth elements 

Plastic 

Tin 

We use 100 percent recycled 
tungsten in the Taptic Engine. This 
represents 99 percent of the total 
tungsten in the device—a first for 
a smartphone.

We use 100 percent recycled rare 
earth elements in all magnets, 
representing an unprecedented 
98 percent of the total rare earth 
elements in the device.

We’re transitioning to plastics 
from renewable or recycled 
sources as alternatives to  
fossil fuel–based plastics. For 
iPhone 12, we use 35 percent  
or more recycled plastic in 
14 components. 

We use 100 percent recycled  
tin in the solder of the main  
logic board. Apple also requires 
100 percent of identified tin, 
tantalum, tungsten, gold, and 
cobalt smelters and refiners to 
participate in third-party audits.6

Smarter chemistry 

iPhone 12 is free of harmful substances like beryllium, brominated flame retardants, PVC, 
phthalates, arsenic in the display glass, and mercury.1 And 100 percent of the materials in  
iPhone 12 are covered by our Regulated Substances Specification. We go beyond what’s  
required by aiming to understand the non-regulated substances in every part of every product—
an effort that requires an industry-leading level of transparency through the entire supply chain. 
We consistently identify the makeup of over 75 percent by mass of iPhone devices.

The Apple Supplier Code of Conduct sets strict standards for  
the protection of people in our supply chain and the planet that  
we all share. Every year, we assess our suppliers’ performance  
in upholding the standards required by our Code. 

We work closely with our suppliers to provide safe and healthy workplaces where people  
are treated with dignity and respect, and to reduce suppliers’ environmental impact. Our 
requirements apply across our supply chain, and include the responsible sourcing of materials. 
From the strong foundation set by our Code, we go further—from helping suppliers transition  
to renewable energy, to providing educational opportunities for their employees, to supporting 
final assembly suppliers in reducing waste.

iPhone 12 packaging is made with 100 percent recycled and 
responsibly sourced wood fiber.  

To improve our packaging, we are working to eliminate plastics, increase recycled content, and 
use less packaging overall. All of the wood fiber in our packaging is either recycled or comes from 
responsibly managed forests.9 And we have protected or created enough responsibly managed 
forests to cover all the virgin wood fiber we use in our packaging.10 This ensures working forests 
are able to regrow and continue to clean our air and purify our water. With the removal of select 
inbox accessories, we reduced the weight of the iPhone 12 packaging by 39 percent and we 
reduced the carbon footprint from shipping.11  And for the first time, we’ve replaced plastic films 
that protect the display with ones made from fiber—one step closer to eliminating plastics in our 
packaging.

iPhone 12 uses 53 percent less energy than the energy 
conservation standard. 

We design our products to be energy efficient, long lasting, and safe. iPhone 12 uses software 
and power-efficient components that intelligently manage power consumption. We also run our 
own Reliability and Environmental Testing Labs, so our products go through rigorous testing 
before they leave our doors. Our support continues throughout each product’s life cycle,  
with regular software updates to keep devices current and a network of authorized repair 
professionals to service them, if necessary.

Energy efficiency 

Apple devices consistently exceed the U.S. Department of Energy Federal 
Energy Conservation Standards for Battery Chargers.12 iPhone 12 consumes  
53 percent less energy than required by this standard.
