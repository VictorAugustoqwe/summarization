Apple and the Environment

Apple believes that improving the environmental performance of our business 
starts with our products. The careful environmental management of our products 
throughout their life cycles includes controlling the quantity and types of materials 
used in their manufacture, improving their energy efficiency, and designing them 
for better recyclability. The information below details the environmental performance 
of iPhone 6s as it relates to climate change, energy efficiency, material efficiency, 
and restricted substances.1

Climate Change 

Greenhouse gas emissions have an impact on the planet’s balance of land, ocean, and air temperatures. 
Most of Apple’s corporate greenhouse gas emissions come from the production, transport, use, and 
recycling of its products. Apple seeks to minimize greenhouse gas emissions by setting stringent design-
related goals for material and energy efficiency. The greenhouse gas emissions associated with the 
aluminum enclosure of iPhone 6s are half those of iPhone 6, thanks to the use of less virgin aluminum  
and more low-carbon aluminum manufacturing. The chart below provides the estimated greenhouse  
gas emissions for iPhone 6s over its life cycle.2

Material Efficiency 

Apple’s ultracompact product and packaging designs lead the industry in material efficiency. Reducing 
the material footprint of a product helps maximize shipping efficiency. It also helps reduce energy 
consumed during production and material waste generated at the end of the product’s life. iPhone 6s is 
made of aluminum and other materials highly desired by recyclers. The chart below details the materials 
used in iPhone 6s.3

U.S. retail packaging of iPhone 6s 
is 20 percent lighter and consumes 
34 percent less volume than the 
first-generation iPhone packaging.

Packaging 

The packaging for iPhone 6s is highly recyclable, and its retail box is made primarily from bio-based 
materials, including fiberboard containing 90 percent post-consumer recycled content. In addition, the 
iPhone 6s packaging is material efficient, allowing 50 percent more units to be transported in an airline 
shipping container compared to the first-generation iPhone. The following table details the materials 
used in iPhone 6s packaging.1

Restricted Substances 

Apple has long taken a leadership role in restricting harmful substances from its products and packaging. 
As part of this strategy, all Apple products comply with the strict European Directive on the Restriction  
of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment, also known as the 
RoHS Directive. Examples of materials restricted by RoHS include lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent 
chromium, and the brominated flame retardants (BFRs) PBB and PBDE. iPhone 6s goes even further 
than the requirements of the RoHS Directive by incorporating the following more aggressive 
restrictions: 

• Arsenic-free display glass 

• Mercury-free LED-backlit display 

• BFR-free 

• PVC-free 

• Beryllium-free 

Recycling 

Through ultra-efficient design and the use of highly recyclable materials, Apple has minimized material 
waste at the product’s end of life. In addition, Apple offers and participates in various product take-back 
and recycling programs in 99 percent of the countries where Apple products are sold. All products are 
processed in the country or region in which they are collected. For more information on how to take 
advantage of these programs, visit www.apple.com/recycling.

Deﬁnitions

Greenhouse gas emissions: Estimated emissions are calculated in accordance with guidelines  
and requirements as speciﬁed by ISO 14040 and ISO 14044. Calculation includes emissions for  
the following life-cycle phases contributing to Global Warming Potential (GWP 100 years) in CO2 
equivalency factors (CO2e): 

• Production: Includes the extraction, production, and transportation of raw materials, as well as the 

manufacture, transport, and assembly of all parts and product packaging.  

• Transport: Includes air and sea transportation of the finished product and its associated packaging 
from manufacturing site to regional distribution hubs. Transport of products from distribution hubs  
to end customer is modeled using average distances based on regional geography. 

• Customer Use: Apple conservatively assumes a three-year period for power use by first owners.  
Product use scenarios are based on historical customer use data for similar products. Geographic 
differences in the power grid mix have been accounted for at a regional level. 

• Recycling: Includes transportation from collection hubs to recycling centers, and the energy used in 

mechanical separation and shredding of parts. 

Energy eﬃciency terms: The energy efficiency values are based on the following conditions: 

• Power adapter no-load: Condition in which the Apple USB Power Adapter with the Lightning to  

USB Cable (1m) is connected to AC power, but not connected to iPhone. 

• Power adapter efficiency: Average of the Apple USB Power Adapter with the Lightning to USB Cable 
(1m) measured efficiency when tested at 100 percent, 75 percent, 50 percent, and 25 percent of the 
power adapter’s rated output current. 

Restricted substances: Apple defines a material as BFR-free and PVC-free if it contains less than 900 parts 
per million (ppm) of bromine and of chlorine. Apple defines a material as beryllium-free if it contains less 
than 1000 parts per million (ppm) of beryllium. A complete list of Apple’s restrictions on hazardous 
substances is available at www.apple.com/environment/answers. 

1. Product evaluations based on U.S. conﬁgurations of iPhone 6s 32GB.
