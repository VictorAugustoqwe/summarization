Product Carbon Footprint

To understand the environmental impacts of our products, at Samsung Electronics,
including the sourcing, production,
we assess a product’s entire life cycle,
distribution, product use and recycling phases.

At the production stage, we are aiming to expand the development and application
of recycled materials with a lower carbon footprint. At the distribution stage, we are
working to minimize packaging volume and weight to reduce carbon emissions.
Through initiatives like improving the energy efficiency of chargers, we are trying to
improve the environmental impact at the use stage.

Sourcing

Across the product lifecycle, from raw material sourcing to
disposal and recycling, we are continuing our efforts to
create a circular economy.

To build toward a circular system, we are using recycled
materials and collecting e-waste to extract materials for
reuse. By 2030, we aim for 50% of the plastic used in our DX
products to incorporate recycled resin. By 2050, we
anticipate to see this figure increase to 100%.

Samsung Galaxy Z Fold5 has a wider variety of recycled materials than any other Galaxy
smartphone, including pre-consumer recycled aluminum and glass and post-consumer
recycled plastics sourced from discarded fishing nets, PET bottles and water barrels :

Plastic
The upper and lower of speaker module are manufactured using a minimum of 20%
repurposed plastic, by weight, sourced form discarded fishing nets and water barrels.
The plastic part of case front are made from a minimum of 10% plastic, by weight,
from recycled PET bottles. The deco film used in the back glass contains a minimum
of 80%, by weight, recycled PET. [4]

Aluminum
In the volume key and SIM card tray components of the device, a minimum of 28% of
the aluminum, by weight,
is recovered scrap sourced from the manufacturing
processes.

Glass
The sub window(the outermost glass of the cover screen) and back glass contain an
average of 22% pre-consumer recycled glass, by weight, recovered from scrap in
manufacturing processes.

To prevent hazardous substances from entering our products, we inspect
manufactured parts and raw materials rigorously through our chemical management
system.

Our Standards for the Control of Substances Used in Products [5] are based on global
regulations and standards, and we voluntarily established reduction plans for the use
of potentially hazardous substances, such as polyvinyl chloride(PVC), brominated
flame retardants(BFRs), beryllium, and antimony, as well as legally regulated
substances.

Production

We are expanding the use of renewable energy at our
business sites around the world.

Energy infrastructure and regulations, which vary widely by
jurisdiction, require region-specific transition plans.

Renewable 
Energy

Safety and health 
certification (ISO) at 
our production sites

100%

We plan to run all operations of the DX(Device eXperience)
Division on renewable energy by 2027. [6]

All of our business sites where Galaxy Z Fold5 is produced
have attained ISO14001(environmental management system)
and ISO50001(energy management system) certifications. [7]

Company-wide, we plan to obtain a platinum-level Zero
Waste to Landfill Certification, issued by safety certification
organization Underwriters Laboratories(UL), for all global
operations by 2025.

Distribution

To reduce the environmental
impact of our product
packaging, we are replacing plastic packaging and protective
films with paper and recycled materials to the extent
possible.

We are also reducing the volume and weight of packaging to
mitigate Greenhouse Gas emissions in the transportation and
shipping process.

Eco 
Packaging

Our goal is to eliminate all single-use plastics in mobile
product packaging by 2025. Since 2017, we have been
exploring ways to eliminate single-use plastics in packaging
by assessing every aspect of packaging design, down to the
smallest details. [8]

Plastic 
In packaging

1.5%

As a result, Galaxy Z Fold5 contains only 1.5% of plastic in
terms of the total weight of packaging. [9]

Reduced plastic 
in packaging

95.1%

Compared to Galaxy S7, when we began our plastic
packaging elimination initiative, we reduced the use of
plastic in packaging for Galaxy Z Fold5 by 95.1%. [10]

Recycled 
paper

100%

Paper used for the Galaxy Z Fold5 packaging box is 100%
recycled paper. [11]

Use

Environmental experts participate throughout product
development at Samsung Electronics so that customer can
more sustainably use our devices.

During the product development phase, our stress tests help
ensure the longevity and consistent performance of our
products. This enables users to enjoy our products for longer
periods of time.

Repair & 
Reuse

Repairability is one of our main priorities in product
development. In August 2022, we expanded the number of
authorized and independent service providers, started a self-
repair program in the US and will continue to expand this
program.

Security Update &
OS Upgrade [12]

5 yrs & 4 gens

Galaxy Z Fold5 has IPX8 [13] water resistance, and we provide
four generations of OS upgrades and five years of security
updates .

Recycling

To promote the circular economy and a low-carbon society,
we are expanding responsible recycling globally.

Samsung's local
recycling programs provide collection
services tailored to each region for customers disposing e-
waste, and we take back all electrical and electronic waste
regardless of product brand.

Collection

Samsung Electronics has installed used mobile phone and
accessory collection boxes at repair centers in 34 countries
including the US, Brazil, and Spain, to take back e-waste
from customers. We plan to expand the scope of our e-waste
collection system from approximately 50 countries to about
180 countries by 2030.
Collected electronic goods are sorted, pre-processed, and
shredded to be recycled as materials. Some of the materials
like plastic are used for new product manufacturing. We also
internally operate Requirements for Recycling Service
Partners that specify requirements such as compliance
obligations related to EHS-related laws and regulations,
supplier management, and prohibition of
illegal waste
exportation.
