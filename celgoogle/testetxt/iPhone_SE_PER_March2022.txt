Taking responsibility for 
our products at every stage 

We take responsibility for our products throughout their life cycles—including the materials 
they are made of, the people who assemble them, and how they are recycled at end of life. 
And we focus on the areas where we can make the biggest difference for our planet: reducing 
our impact on climate change, conserving important resources, and using safer materials. 

We sell millions of products. 
So making even small 
adjustments can have a 
meaningful impact.

Carbon footprint  

We continue to make progress in reducing Apple’s contribution to climate change—by focusing 
on making energy-efficient products with renewable or recycled materials and with renewable 
energy. Suppliers’ use of renewable energy through our Supplier Clean Energy Program helped 
reduce the overall iPhone SE (3rd generation) carbon footprint by more than 16 percent 
compared with the previous generation.4 Apple is committed to using carbon life cycle 
assessments to identify opportunities to drive down product greenhouse gas emissions.

Source Materials 

iPhone SE (3rd generation) is made with 100 percent recycled rare 
earth elements in the Taptic Engine and audio magnets. 

To conserve important resources, we work to reduce the material we use and aim to one day 
source only recycled or renewable materials in our products. And as we make this transition, 
we remain committed to the responsible sourcing of primary materials. We map many materials, 
some to the mineral source, and establish the strictest standards for smelters and refiners. 
Apple also requires 100 percent of identified tin, tantalum, tungsten, gold, cobalt, and lithium 
smelters and refiners to participate in third-party audits.5 We’re proud to be recognized as a 
worldwide leader in the responsible sourcing of minerals in our products. Our product designs 
also consider the safety of those who make, use, and recycle our products, restricting the use 
of hundreds of harmful substances. Our standards go beyond what’s required by law to protect 
people and the environment.

Tungsten 

Rare earth elements 

Plastic 

Tin 

We use 100 percent recycled 
tungsten in the Taptic Engine, 
which represents 100 percent of 
the total tungsten in the device.6 

We use 100 percent recycled 
rare earth elements in the Taptic 
Engine and audio magnets, 
representing 91 percent of the 
total rare earth elements in the 
device.

We’re transitioning from fossil 
fuel–based plastics to those 
made from renewable or 
recycled sources. For iPhone SE 
(3rd generation), we use 
35 percent or more recycled 
plastic in six components.

We use 100 percent recycled 
tin in the solder of the main 
logic board.

Smarter chemistry 

iPhone SE (3rd generation) is free of harmful substances like beryllium, brominated flame 
retardants, PVC, phthalates, arsenic in the display glass, and mercury.1 And 100 percent of the 
materials in iPhone SE (3rd generation) are covered by our Regulated Substances Specification. 
We go beyond what’s required by aiming to understand the non-regulated substances in every 
part of every product—an effort that requires an industry-leading level of transparency through 
the entire supply chain. We consistently identify the makeup of over 75 percent by mass of 
iPhone devices.

The Apple Supplier Code of Conduct sets strict standards for 
the protection of people in our supply chain and the planet that 
we all share. Every year, we assess our suppliers’ performance 
in upholding the standards required by our Code. 

We work closely with our suppliers to provide safe and healthy workplaces where people 
are treated with dignity and respect, and to reduce suppliers’ environmental impact. Our 
requirements apply across our supply chain and include the responsible sourcing of materials. 
From the strong foundation set by our Code, we go further—from helping suppliers transition 
to renewable energy, to providing educational opportunities for their employees, to supporting 
final assembly suppliers in reducing waste.

Zero Waste to Landfill 

No established iPhone SE (3rd generation) 

final assembly supplier sites generate any 

waste sent to landfill.8

Supplier energy use 

All iPhone SE (3rd generation) final 

assembly supplier sites are transitioning 

to 100 percent renewable energy for 

Apple production. 

Greener chemicals 

All established iPhone SE (3rd generation) 

final assembly supplier sites use safer 

cleaners and degreasers in their 

manufacturing processes, as determined 

by methodologies like the GreenScreen® 

assessment.7

We eliminated the need for the outer plastic wrap by redesigning the 
packaging with a seal that protects the product during transit. This 
brings us one step closer to our goal of completely removing plastic 
from all our packaging by 2025. 

To improve our packaging, we are working to eliminate plastics, increase recycled content, and 
use less packaging overall. All of the wood fiber in our packaging is either recycled or comes 
from responsibly managed forests.9 And we have protected or created enough responsibly 
managed forests to cover all the virgin wood fiber we use in our packaging.10 This ensures 
working forests are able to regrow and continue to clean our air and purify our water.

iPhone SE (3rd generation) uses 64 percent less energy than the 
energy conservation standard.12 

We design our products to be energy efficient, long-lasting, and safe. iPhone SE (3rd generation) 
uses software and power-efficient components that intelligently manage power consumption. 
We also run our own Reliability and Environmental Testing Labs, where our products go through 
rigorous testing before they leave our doors. Our support continues throughout each product’s 
life cycle, with regular software updates to keep devices current and a network of authorized 
repair professionals to service them, if necessary.

Energy efficiency 

Apple devices consistently exceed the U.S. Department of Energy 
Federal Energy Conservation Standards for Battery Chargers.12 
iPhone SE (3rd generation) consumes 64 percent less energy than 
required by this standard.

Return your product with Apple Trade In, and we’ll ensure it has 
a long life or recycle it for free.  

When products are used longer, fewer resources are extracted from the earth. That’s why we 
launched Apple Trade In—it offers customers a seamless way to return their old devices and 
accessories to Apple. Eligible devices can be traded in for credit or an Apple Store Gift Card, 
while accessories and other devices can be recycled for free.13 We also offer and participate
in product take-back and recycling collection programs for 99 percent of the countries where 
we sell products—and we hold our recyclers to high standards. Our efforts to keep harmful 
substances out of our products also mean our materials are safer to recover and reuse.

iPhone recycling  

We designed a disassembly robot, Daisy, to take 

apart iPhone devices into distinct components. Our 

newest disassembly robot, Dave, takes the next 

step: disassembling the Taptic Engine to recover 

materials like rare earth elements and tun
