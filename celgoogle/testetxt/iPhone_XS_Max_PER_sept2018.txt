iPhone Xs Max 
Environmental Report

Apple and the Environment 

Apple believes that improving the environmental performance of our 
business starts with our products. The careful environmental management 
of our products throughout their life cycles includes controlling the quantity 
and types of materials used in their manufacture, improving their energy 
efficiency, and designing them for better recyclability. The information below 
details the environmental performance of iPhone Xs Max as it relates to 
climate change, energy efficiency, material efficiency, and restricted 
substances.1 

Climate Change 

Greenhouse gas emissions have an impact on the planet’s balance of land, ocean, and air 
temperatures. Most of Apple’s greenhouse gas emissions come from the production, transport, 
use, and recycling of our products. Apple seeks to minimize product-related greenhouse gas 

emissions by setting stringent design-related goals for material and energy efficiency, and by 
increasing use of renewable energy in our supply chain. 

In addition, Apple’s Supplier Clean Energy program has enabled direct iPhone suppliers to 
develop their own renewable energy projects to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These 

projects resulted in a 7 percent decrease in the greenhouse gas emissions from iPhone production, 
compared to what they would have been without renewable energy.2 The chart below provides the 

estimated greenhouse gas emissions for iPhone Xs Max over its life cycle.3

Energy Efficiency 

iPhone Xs Max uses power-efficient components and software that intelligently manages power 

consumption. The following table details the energy efficiency of the Apple USB Power Adapter. 

Battery design 

iPhone Xs Max features a lithium-ion 
polymer battery chemistry that is free of 
lead, cadmium, and mercury. This allows 
for an extended lifespan, and is designed 
to deliver up to 500 full charge and 
discharge cycles before it reaches
80 percent of its original capacity.

Material Efficiency 
Apple’s ultracompact product and packaging designs lead the industry in material efficiency. 
Reducing the material footprint of a product helps maximize shipping efficiency. It also helps reduce 

energy consumed during production and material waste generated at the end of the product’s life. 
iPhone Xs Max is made of stainless steel and other materials highly desired by recyclers. To help 

achieve Apple’s goal of using only recycled or renewable materials, iPhone Xs Max utilizes materials 
that reduce dependence on finite resources: the main logic board is assembled with 100 percent 

recycled tin solder, the cover glass frame is made with 32 percent bio-based plastic, and the 
speaker enclosure is made with 35 percent post-consumer recycled content. The chart below 

details the materials used in iPhone Xs Max.5

Packaging 

The packaging for iPhone Xs Max is highly recyclable, and 100 percent of the fiber in its retail box is 

from recycled content, bamboo, waste sugarcane, or responsibly managed forests. Through design 
and material selection, nearly all of the plastics in the packaging have been eliminated. The following 

table details the materials used in iPhone Xs Max packaging.1 

U.S. retail packaging of iPhone Xs Max 
contains 55 percent recycled content.

Restricted Substances 

Apple has long taken a leadership role in restricting harmful substances from our products and 
packaging. As part of this strategy, all Apple products comply with the strict European Directive on 

the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment, 
also known as the RoHS Directive. Examples of materials restricted by RoHS include lead, mercury, 

cadmium, hexavalent chromium, and the brominated flame retardants (BFRs) PBB and PBDE. 
iPhone Xs Max goes even further than the requirements of the RoHS Directive by incorporating the 

following more aggressive restrictions: 

• Arsenic-free display glass 

• Mercury-free display 

• BFR-free 

• PVC-free 

• Beryllium-free 

Recycling 

Through efficient design and the use of highly recyclable materials, Apple has minimized material 

waste at the product’s end of life. Through Apple GiveBack, customers can trade in eligible devices 
for an Apple Store Gift Card. If it’s not eligible for credit, we’ll recycle it for free. In addition, Apple 

offers and participates in various product take-back and recycling programs in 99 percent of the 
countries where Apple sells products, including at every Apple Store. For more information on how 
to recycle your products at end of life, visit www.apple.com/giveback.

Definitions 

Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT): A program that ranks mobile 

phones based on environmental attributes in accordance with UL 110. For more information, visit 
www.epeat.net. 

Greenhouse gas emissions: Estimated emissions are calculated in accordance with guidelines 
and requirements as specified by ISO 14040 and ISO 14044. Calculation includes emissions for 

the following life-cycle phases contributing to Global Warming Potential (GWP 100 years) in CO2 
equivalency factors (CO2e): 

• Production: Includes the extraction, production, and transportation of raw materials, as well 

as the manufacture, transport, and assembly of all parts and product packaging.  

• Transport: Includes air and sea transportation of the finished product and its associated 

packaging from manufacturing site to regional distribution hubs. Transport of products from 

distribution hubs to end customer is modeled using average distances based on regional 
geography. 

• Customer use: Apple conservatively assumes a three-year period for power use by first owners. 
Product use scenarios are based on historical customer use data for similar products. Geographic 

differences in the power grid mix have been accounted for at a regional level. 

• Recycling: Includes transportation from collection hubs to recycling centers, and the energy 

used in mechanical separation and shredding of parts. 

Energy efficiency terms: The energy efficiency values are based on the following conditions. 

• Power adapter, no-load: Condition in which the Apple USB Power Adapter with the Lightning to 

USB Cable (1m) is connected to AC power, but not connected to iPhone. 

• Power adapter efficiency: Average of the Apple USB Power Adapter with the Lightning to 

USB Cable (1m) measured efficiency when tested at 100 percent, 75 percent, 50 percent, and 

25 percent of the power adapter’s rated output current. 

Restricted substances: Apple defines a material as BFR-free and PVC-free if it contains less than 

900 parts per million (ppm) of bromine and of chlorine. Apple defines a material as beryllium-free if 
it contains less than 1000 parts per million (ppm) of beryllium. Apple defines a material as RoHS 

compliant if it conforms to European Union Directive 2011/65/EU and its amendments, including 
exemptions for the use of lead. Apple is working to phase out the use of these exempted substances 

where technically possible. A complete list of Apple’s restrictions on hazardous substances is 
included in Apple’s Regulated Substances Specification at www.apple.com/environment/reports.
