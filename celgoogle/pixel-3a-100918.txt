Sustainability

at Google

At Google, operating in an environmentally sustainable way 

has been a core value from the beginning. As our business 

has evolved to include the manufacturing of electronic 

products, we’ve continually expanded our efforts to 

improve each product’s environmental performance

and minimize Google’s impact on the world around us.

This report details the environmental performance of 

Google Pixel 3a over its full life cycle, from design and

manufacturing through usage and recycling.

Product highlights

The Pixel 3a phone is designed with the following key features to help 

EPEAT registered 

with Gold rating 

for sustainability1

reduce its environmental impact:

Mercury-free LED-backlit display

Arsenic-free glass

PVC-free

Product Environmental ReportPage 2Google Pixel 3a, Model G020X(E~H)Greenhouse gas

(GHG) emissions

The production, transportation, use, and recycling of electronic products 

generate GHG emissions that can contribute to rising global temperatures. 

Google conducts a life cycle assessment on products to identify materials 

and processes that contribute to GHG emissions, with the goal of

minimizing these emissions.

Pixel 3a is designed to be light and compact. Minimizing the size and weight 

of the Pixel 3a allows materials to be used more efficiently, thereby reducing 

the energy consumed during production and shipping as well as minimizing 

the amount of packaging.

Restricted substances

Historically, many electronic devices contained materials such as

lead, mercury, cadmium, and brominated flame retardants that pose

environmental and health risks. We designed Pixel 3a to meet global

regulations that restrict harmful substances, including the following:

European RoHS Directive restrictions on lead, mercury, cadmium,

hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls (PBB), and

polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE)

European Battery Directive restrictions on lead, mercury, and

cadmium in batteries

European Packaging Directive restrictions on lead, mercury,

cadmium, and hexavalent chromium in packaging

Brominated flame retardant–free

Packaging

Packaging for Pixel 3a uses 94% paper and fiber-based materials.

The chipboard material used in the box base and lid is made with 100% 

recycled content. We have designed the Pixel 3a packaging to minimize

its weight and volume, which helps conserve natural resources and allows 

more devices to be transported in a single shipping container.
