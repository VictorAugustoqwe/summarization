Sustainability

at Google

At Google, operating in an environmentally sustainable way 

has been a core value from the beginning. As our business 

has evolved to include the manufacturing of electronic 

products, we’ve continually expanded our efforts to 

improve each product’s environmental performance

and minimize Google’s impact on the world around us.

This report details the environmental performance of 

Google Pixel 2 over its full life cycle, from design and

manufacturing through usage and recycling.

Product Environmental ReportPage 2Google Pixel 2, Model G011AGreenhouse gas

(GHG) emissions

The production, transportation, use, and recycling of electronic products 

generate GHG emissions that can contribute to rising global temperatures. 

Google conducts a life cycle assessment on products to identify materials 

and processes that contribute to GHG emissions, with the goal of

minimizing these emissions.

Pixel 2 is designed to be light and compact. Minimizing the size and

weight of Pixel 2 allows materials to be used more efficiently, thereby

reducing the energy consumed during production and shipping as well

as minimizing the amount of packaging.

Restricted substances

Historically, many electronic devices contained materials such as

lead, mercury, cadmium, and brominated flame retardants that pose

environmental and health risks. We designed Pixel 2 to meet global

regulations that restrict harmful substances, including the following:

European RoHS Directive restrictions on lead, mercury, cadmium,

hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls (PBB), and

polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE)

European Battery Directive restrictions on lead, mercury, and

cadmium in batteries

European Packaging Directive restrictions on lead, mercury,

cadmium, and hexavalent chromium in packaging

Brominated flame retardant–free

Packaging

Packaging for Pixel 2 uses 99% paper and fiber-based materials. The 

chipboard material that forms the underlying structural layer of the

box base and lid is made of 100% recycled content. We have designed

the Pixel 2 packaging to minimize its weight and volume, which helps 

conserve natural resources and allows more devices to be transported

in a single shipping container.

Endnotes

1.

This product is EPEAT registered in the United States only.

2.

GHG emissions estimates are calculated in accordance with ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 requirements

and guidelines for conducting life cycle assessments and include the production, transportation, use,

and recycling of the product, accessories, and packaging.

3.

Level VI is the highest available efficiency rating for power adapters as defined in the International

Efficiency Marking Protocol for External Power Supplies Version 3.0.

4.

This is the average efficiency of the power adapter when input and output power is measured at 25%, 50%, 

75%, and 100% of rated output current and averaged as part of testing in accordance with the U.S. Department 

of Energy Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of External Power Supplies.

5.

Power is measured when the power adapter is plugged into an AC power source without being connected 

to the product. Testing is done in accordance with the U.S. Department of Energy Uniform Test Method for 

Measuring the Energy Consumption of External Power Supplies.

6.

Power is measured with the phone in standby mode with a fully charged battery and while attached to

the power adapter. Testing is done in accordance with the U.S. Department of Energy Uniform Test Method 

for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Battery Chargers.

7.

Estimated energy use is based on fully charging the battery once per day with the phone attached to the 

power adapter for 12 hours and leaving the power adapter plugged into AC power without the phone 

attached (i.e., no load) for 12 hours. Testing is done in accordance with the U.S. Department of Energy 

Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Battery Chargers.

8.

The average residential cost of energy for U.S. households is $0.13 per kWh (source: U.S. Energy

Information Agency May 2017 report).

9.

The average household cost of energy for consumers in the European Union was €0.211 per kWh in

the second half of 2015 (source: Eurostat Statistics Explained).

10.

Product material weights are for Google Pixel 2 only. For the U.S. configuration, an additional 91 g

of electronic accessories can be included in-box.
