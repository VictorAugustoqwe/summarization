sustainability 

at Google 

At Google, operating in an environmentally sustainable way 

has been a core value from the beginning. As our business 

has evolved to include the manufacturing of electronic 

products, we’ve continually expanded our efforts to improve 

each product’s environmental performance and minimize 

Google’s impact on the world around us.

This report details the environmental performance of the 

Pixel Fold over its full life cycle, from design and 

manufacturing through usage and recycling.

Product highlights

The Pixel Fold is designed with the following key features to help 

reduce its environmental impact:

Greenhouse Gas 

(GHG) emissions

The production, transportation, use, and recycling of electronic 

products generate GHG emissions that can contribute to rising global 

temperatures. Google conducted a life cycle assessment on this 

product to identify materials and processes that contribute to GHG 

emissions, with the goal of minimizing these emissions.

Material use

Pixel Fold is designed to be light and compact. Minimizing the size and 

weight of the Pixel Fold allows materials to be used more efficiently, 

thereby reducing the energy consumed during production and 

shipping as well as minimizing the amount of packaging.

Restricted substances

Historically, many electronic devices contained materials such as lead, 

mercury, cadmium, and brominated flame retardants that pose 

environmental and health risks. We designed Pixel Fold to meet global 

regulations that restrict harmful substances, including the following:

European RoHS Directive restrictions on lead, mercury, 

cadmium, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls 

(PBB), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), and four 

different phthalates (DEHP, BBP, DBP, DIBP)

European Battery Directive restrictions on lead, mercury, and 

cadmium in batteries

European Packaging Directive restrictions on lead, mercury, 

cadmium, and hexavalent chromium in packaging

Voluntary substance 

restrictions

Pixel Fold also meets the following voluntary substance restrictions:13 

PVC-free3

Brominated Flame Retardant (BFR)-free3

Packaging

Packaging for the Pixel Fold uses 99% plastic-free materials.5 We have 

designed the Pixel Fold packaging to minimize its weight and volume, 

which helps conserve natural resources and allows more devices to 

be transported in a single shipping container.

Ethical sourcing

Google and its subsidiaries are committed to ensuring that working 

conditions in our operations and in our supply chains are safe, that all 

workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that business 

operations are environmentally responsible and ethically conducted.

UL Ecologo-registered in the US only.

Pixel Fold is designed with approximately 14% recycled content across its plastic parts. 

This does not include plastics in printed circuit boards, labels,  cables, connectors, 

electronic components and modules, optical components, electrostatic discharge (ESD) 

components, electromagnetic interference (EMI) components, films, coatings and 

adhesives.

3.

Google defines its restrictions on harmful substances in the Google Restricted 

Substances Specification.

4.

Carbon footprint reduction claim based on third-party verified life cycle assessment. 

Recycled aluminum in the housing is approximately 14% of product based on weight.

5.

Based on retail packaging (excluding adhesive materials) as shipped by Google. To meet 

the request of some clients, plastic stickers are applied to some packaging variations.

6.

GHG emissions estimates are calculated in accordance with ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 

requirements and guidelines for conducting life cycle assessments, and include the 

production, transportation, use, and recycling of the product, accessories, and 

packaging. 

7.

Power measured with phone connected to cellular and WiFi networks in standby mode 

with fully charged battery and attached to the power adapter. Tested in accordance with 

the U.S. DOE Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of Battery 

Chargers. Energy consumption patterns may vary when adaptive charging is enabled.

8.

Based on average charging of previous Pixel phones. Actual energy consumption will vary 

by user.
