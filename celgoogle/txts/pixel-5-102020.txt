sustainability 

at Google 

At Google, operating in an environmentally sustainable way 

has been a core value from the beginning. As our business has 

evolved to include the manufacturing of electronic products, 

we’ve continually expanded our efforts to improve each product’s 

environmental performance and minimize Google’s impact on 

the world around us. 

This report details the environmental performance of the Pixel 5 

over its full life cycle, from design and manufacturing through 

usage and recycling.

Greenhouse Gas

(GHG) emissions

The production, transportation, use, and recycling of electronic products  

generate GHG emissions that can contribute to rising global temperatures. 

Google conducts a life cycle assessment on products to identify materials 

and processes that contribute to GHG emissions, with the goal of  

minimizing these emissions.

Material use

Pixel 5 is designed to be light and compact. Minimizing the size and weight 

of the Pixel 5 allows materials to be used more efficiently, thereby reducing 

the energy consumed during production and shipping as well as minimizing 

the amount of packaging.

Restricted substances

Historically, many electronic devices contained materials such as 

lead, mercury, cadmium, and brominated flame retardants that pose

environmental and health risks. We designed the Pixel 5 to meet global 

regulations that restrict harmful substances, including the following:

European RoHS Directive restrictions on lead, mercury, cadmium, 
hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls (PBB), polybrominated 
diphenyl ethers (PBDE), and four different phthalates (DEHP, BBP, DBP, 
DIBP)

European Battery Directive restrictions on lead, mercury, and cadmium 

in batteries

European Packaging Directive restrictions on lead, mercury, cadmium, 

and hexavalent chromium in packaging

Packaging

Packaging for the Pixel 5 uses 98% paper and fiber-based materials. The 

chipboard material used in the box base and lid is made with 100% recycled 

content. We have designed the Pixel 5 packaging to minimize its weight and 

volume, which helps conserve natural resources and allows more devices to 

be transported in a single shipping container.
