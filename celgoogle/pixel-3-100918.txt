Sustainability

at Google

At Google, operating in an environmentally sustainable way 

has been a core value from the beginning. As our business 

has evolved to include the manufacturing of electronic 

products, we’ve continually expanded our efforts to 

improve each product’s environmental performance

and minimize Google’s impact on the world around us.

This report details the environmental performance of 

Google Pixel 3 over its full life cycle, from design and

manufacturing through usage and recycling.

Product highlights

The Pixel 3 phone is designed with the following key features to help 

EPEAT registered 

with Gold rating 

for sustainability1

reduce its environmental impact:

Mercury-free flexible OLED display

Arsenic-free glass

PVC-free

Brominated flame retardant-free

95% paper and fiber-based packaging

Power adapter with Level VI efficiency rating

Product Environmental ReportPage 2Google Pixel 3, Model G013AGreenhouse gas

(GHG) emissions

The production, transportation, use, and recycling of electronic products 

generate GHG emissions that can contribute to rising global temperatures. 

Google conducts a life cycle assessment on products to identify materials 

and processes that contribute to GHG emissions, with the goal of

minimizing these emissions.

Product Environmental ReportPage 3Google Pixel 3, Model G013AMaterial use

Pixel 3 is designed to be light and compact. Minimizing the size and weight 

of the Pixel 3 allows materials to be used more efficiently, thereby reducing 

the energy consumed during production and shipping as well as minimizing 

the amount of packaging.

Restricted substances

Historically, many electronic devices contained materials such as

lead, mercury, cadmium, and brominated flame retardants that pose

environmental and health risks. We designed Pixel 3 to meet global

regulations that restrict harmful substances, including the following:

European RoHS Directive restrictions on lead, mercury, cadmium,

hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls (PBB), and

polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE)

European Battery Directive restrictions on lead, mercury, and

cadmium in batteries

European Packaging Directive restrictions on lead, mercury,

cadmium, and hexavalent chromium in packaging

Mercury-free flexible OLED display

Arsenic-free display glass

PVC-free

Brominated flame retardant–free

Packaging

Packaging for Pixel 3 uses 95% paper and fiber-based materials. The 

chipboard material that forms the underlying structural layer of the

box base and lid is made of 100% recycled content. We have designed

the Pixel 3 packaging to minimize its weight and volume, which helps 

conserve natural resources and allows more devices to be transported

in a single shipping container.

Endnotes

1.

This product is EPEAT registered in the United States only.

2.

GHG emissions estimates are calculated in accordance with ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 requirements

and guidelines for conducting life cycle assessments, and include the production, transportation, use,

and recycling of the product, accessories, and packaging. 

3.

Level VI is the highest available efficiency rating for power adapters as defined in the International

Efficiency Marking Protocol for External Power Supplies Version 3.0. 

4.

Average efficiency of power adapter when input and output power is measured at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 

100% of rated output current and averaged. Tested in accordance with the U.S. Department of Energy 

Uniform Test Method for Measuring the Energy Consumption of External Power Supplies.
